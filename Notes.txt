OPTICAL FLOW
- Do we need to account for optical flow?
	- How would it impare our ability to identify drop-offs?
	- How fast is the robot and how much would it's motion cause that?
	- How much would the camer's ability speed void the effect of that?
	- https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_lucas_kanade.html

- optical flow can be use to exclude non drop-offs and narrow down the data set. 


COMPARING TO OTHERS
"In contrast to traditional obstacle-
detection techniques, we do not recover a depth map of the
scene, nor do we rely on the reflectance properties of obsta-
cles"

HOW THE PAPER IDENTIFIES PRECIPISE
This paper inloys the difference in optical flow vectors with proximity to determine which objects are not part of the grownd plane. 
To do so the writers split the image into segments and compare the average length of their optical flow vectors. If there is difference between one patch's average optical flow and its neighbors' it is flaged as a hazard or "precipice"

TITLE: A Deep-Network Solution Towards Model-less Obstacle Avoidance

Paper that uses NNs to identiry terrain:
"D. Maturana et. al proposed an autonomous UAV landing system, where
deep-learning is only used to classify the terrain [2]"

Ulrich2000

relys on an onmican to perform topological localization.

Uses histograms of the images to identify reference image.

uses nearest-neighbor algorithms to match the image with a reference. Performs that on every color band separately and uses a voting system to select a result.
Histograms of images are used for the nearest-neighbor calculation

NOTES: 
I did not think that this paper would benefit the problem I am tackeling. the main intent of the paper was to identify topological location using what is essetially suppervised learning.
